# US 315 - Check if a container is in a certain position

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a Port staff, given a position in the transport vehicle, I wish to know if a container is there or not.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

> Containers can be transported by land or sea. Every ship has the containers according to a threeaxis displacement.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The free/occupied position should be determined by an Assembly function that verifies the matrix filled with the containersâ€™ IDs.
* **AC2:** The function should return 1 if a container is there or 0, otherwise.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies
* There is a dependency with US313:"Fill a statically reserved matrix in memory with each container's ID", since the program needs the data of all positions of the vehicle 

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* Containers' ID
	* Its position

* Selected data:
    * none

**Output Data:**

* 1 if the container is in that position and 0 if not.

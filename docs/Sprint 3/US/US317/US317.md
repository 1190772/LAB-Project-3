#US 317 - container materials to operate at temperatures of 7ÂºC

## 1. Outer Walls
2 cm of Corten Steel type B weather resistant
Thermal conductivity: 25k thermal conductivity
Composition by mass (%):
= 0.19 C
= 0.020/0.06 Al
= 0.30/0.65 Si
= 0.02/0.10 V
= 0.80/1.25 Mn
= 0.25/0.40 Cu
= 0.035 P
= 0.40/0.65 Cr
= 0.030 S
= 0.40 Ni

## 2. middle walls
6 cm of Expanded polystyrene 
Thermal conductivity : 0,046 k
Is made of 98% trapped air and only 2% plastic, making it an efficient insulator with a small amount of raw material

## 3. interior walls
2 cm Bamboo 
Thermal conductivity : 0,55 k
Cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin are the three major chemical compositions of bamboo, and they are closely associated in a complex structure

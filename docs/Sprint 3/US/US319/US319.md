## Container to maintain -5ºC of temperature
The container's walls are composed by three materials:
* 2.5 cm of stainless steel type 304, with 16.2 W/mK of thermal conductivity, as the outer wall
* 5 cm of Polyurethane foam, with 0.03 W/mK of thermal conductivity, as the middle layer
* 2.5 cm of plywood, with 0.13 W/mK of thermal conductivity, as the interior wall

Using the previous equations:

## Container to maintain 7ºC of temperature
The container's walls are composed by three materials:
* 2 cm of Corten Steel type B weather resistant, with 25 W/mK of thermal conductivity, as the outer wall
* 6 cm of Expanded polystyrene, with 0.046 W/mK of thermal conductivity, as the middle layer
* 2 cm Bamboo, with 0.55 W/mK of thermal conductivity, as the interior wall

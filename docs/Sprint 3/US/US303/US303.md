# US 303 - Know which places are closest to all other places

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a Traffic manager, I wish to know which places (cities or ports) are closest to all other places (closeness places).


### 1.2. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** Return the n closeness locals by continent.

* **AC2:** The measure of proximity is calculated as the average of the shortest path length from the local to all other locals in the network.

### 1.3. Found out Dependencies
* There is a dependency with US301:"Build Freight Network", since the program needs the data to calculate the distance between ports, between capitals and between both. 


### 1.4 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* Number of countries per continent

* Selected data:
    * none

**Output Data:**

* none

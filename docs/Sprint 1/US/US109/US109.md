# US 109 - Database Integrity Restrictions

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As Project Manager, I want the team to draft an SQL script to test whether the database verifies all the data integrity restrictions that are required to fulfil the purpose of the system and the business constraints of the UoD.

### 1.2. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** There is a catalogue of data integrity restrictions grouped by type (Domain, Identity, Referential, Application) clearly stated.
* **AC2:** For each data integrity restriction in the catalogue there is a set of SQL instructions that verify the restriction.
* **AC3:** All SQL instruction in the data integrity verification script are accompanied by a comment that describes the expected result (Pass or Fail; in the latter a justification is given).

### 1.3. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US108: develop the data model" since first the database must be created.

# US 105 - To list for all ships the MMSI, the total number of movements, Travelled Distance and Delta Distance.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a traffic manger, I wish to list for all ships the MMSI, the total number of movements, Travelled Distance and Delta Distance.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Ships are characterized by:  
    * MMSI: unique 9-digit ship identification code.  
    * Ship name.  
    * Ship identification according to the IMO identification number.  
    * Numbers of energy generators.  
    * Generatorâ€™s power output.    
    * Call sign: ship's unique callsign.  
    * Vessel type: ship type, numerically coded.  
    * Length: ship length, in meters.  
    * Width: ship width, in meters.  
    * Capacity: ship load capacity in m3.
    * Draft: Vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the ship's hull, in meters.

>   Dynamic data fields relating to a ship's positioning data:
    * Base Date Time: date/time of AIS message.
    * Latitude: ship latitude (in degrees: [-90; 90], negative value represents South, 91 indicates 'not available').
    * Longitude: ship longitude (in degrees: [-180; 180], negative value represents West, 181 indicates 'not available').
    * Speed over ground (SOG).
    * Course over ground (COG): direction relative to absolute North (in degrees: [0; 359]).
    * Heading: ship heading (in degrees: [0; 359], 511 indicates 'not available').
    * Position: ship code in tow.
    * Transceiver Class: class to transceiver used when sending data.
 

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The list should be ordered by Travelled Distance and total number of movements (descending/ascending).


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US104: To make a Summary of a ship's movements" since the list needs data from the ship's movements.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* none

* Selected data:
    * to order by Travelled/Delta Distance Ascending/Descending 

**Output Data:**

* List for all ships the MMSI, the total number of movements, Travelled Distance and Delta Distance.

# US 414 - Know how much energy to supply to the container cargo, in a trip, depending on the position of the containers
## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As Ship Chief Electrical Engineer, you want to know how much energy to supply
to the container cargo, in a voyage (or route), depending on the position of the containers
on the ship. Admitting that the interior containers, or the sides not exposed directly to the
"sun", maintain the initial temperature, or of departure. However, the exposed sides may
present temperature variations during the trip.


### 1.2. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** Know the journey time.

* **AC2:** Know the temperatures of the travel sections.
           
* **AC3:** Know how many sides of each container are subject to temperature variation.
                      
* **AC4:** Determine the energy required for one trip of the containers at a temperature of 7 ºC, depending on their position in the load.
 
* **AC5:** Determine the energy required for one trip of the containers at a temperature of -5 ºC, depending on their position in the cargo 
                                  

### 1.3 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* energy per type of container
	* energy as function of container positions

* Selected data:
    * sides of the container exposed to the sun

**Output Data:**

* the amount of energy needed to maintain the containers

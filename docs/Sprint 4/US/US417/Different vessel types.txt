3 types of vessels : Control bridge at the stern, at the bow and at the midship.

Stern: Most of the cargo ships, sailing vessels, oil tanker vessels
- It is easier to maneuver the ship with the control bridge on the stern because you have a
 wider view of both the structure of the ship itself and the ocean.
- With big waves the ship is more comfortable in the stern than in the bow. As the crew's rooms 
and amenities are usually on the control bridge side, it makes sense that this is on the stern.
- At the bow, the water sprayed to the control bridge is much greater than at the stern, so if it 
is at the stern, the wear will be much less.
- The engine room and the helm are located at the rear of the ship and normally the controls for both 
are kept at close distances to be as reliable as possible.
- Sailboats are favored by the control bridge at the bow where it is easier to keep an eye on the sails and masts.
- Many vessels that load from oilfields while moored usually load at the bow.


Bow: Ferries and passenger ships, newer container vessels, supply vessels
- As the structure of ferries and passenger ships is very large, it is not possible to see the ocean 
in the best way with the control bridge at the stern.
- In the most recent container vessels there is also the same problem. The large number of containers obstructs
 the view of the sea and so it makes more sense for the control bridge to be in the bow or sometimes in the midship.
- Supply vessels also usually have the control bridge at the bow as they have a large working deck and are favored 
by a good view on the work area.


Midship: Some container vessels and cargo ships
- On some cargo ships it is better to have the control bridge in the midship to balance the weight.
- Some cargo ships have a large amount of containers that obstructs the view so it makes sense to have a 
control bridge at midship rather at the bow because the bow is not confortable to travel with big waves and 
a control bridge at the midship will have less wear than at the bow.


Basically the position of the control bridge has only to do with its functionality and practicality and varies from ship to ship. 
Stern control bridge is more comfortable, gives a better view of the ship, is less prone to water wear and makes navigation easier 
in addition to compacting the crew's amenities.
Control bridge on the bow offers a better overview of the ocean in cases of large loads and large structures.
Control bridge in the midship offers the same advantages as in the bow but has the advantage of having less water wear than the 
bow and offering better stability in terms of weight to the ship in some cases even if the visibility is not as good as in the bow.

#Necessary energy to supply container
##Theory
To calculate how much energy is needed for a container to maintain his internal energy we need to know the following values:
1.	Delta_t, which is the variation of time, meaning:

Delta_t = exterior temperature – interior temperature of the container (ºC)

2.Rt, meaning:

Rt = Rmaterial1 + … + Rmaterialn (w/mk)

Rmaterialn   =               thickness                         
                thermal conductivity * exposed area

2.1	Area, meaning
Area = c + 2*a + 2*c = 56,5592 m

2.2	Length, Width, Height, which are

Length = 6,1 m
Width = 2,44m
Height = 2,44 m
2.3 a, b, c, which are

a = width*height = 5,9536 m 
b = length*height = 14,884 m 
c = width*length = 14,884 m

3.	Time, which will be equal to 2h 30min, meaning

Time = 2,5 * 3600 = 9000 (secs)

With all these values found then we can use this equation to know exactly what we need, the energy:

Energy = Delta_t  * Time (J)
